In data science, the result is often a report or a story that aims to 
influence people's behavior or company decisions. No matter whether you are a journalist 
writing an article about government spending or an analyst producing internal sales reports, 
you are _telling stories with data_.

Being able to tell stories with data (but also verify and assess other people's stories that 
can be backed by data) is becoming a vital skill in the modern world, which is why this  
topic is extremely important and also interesting. To do this currently, you need to be a 
skilled programmer, great designer and good storyteller, all at the same time!

The Gamma is a project that aims to make open, transparent data-driven storytelling easier
and more accessible. If you want to read more about the motivation about the project,
have a look at the [The Gamma and Digital News Innovation Fund](http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/thegamma-dni/)
announcement.

### Visualizing Olympic Medals

<a href="http://rio2016.thegamma.net"><img src="/img/olympics.png" style="width:200px;float:right;margin:10px 0px 10px 10px" /></a>

This project shows a second iteration of The Gamma. You can explore a number of 
interactive visualizations built around the Olympic medals data set. Code for all 
the visualizations can be run, modified and shared from the browser.

See [the project live](http://rio2016.thegamma.net) and explore the data on your own!
You can find more about the work in [an associated blog post](http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/thegamma-olympic-medalists/)
and the source code is also [available on GitHub](https://github.com/the-gamma/thegamma-olympics-web).
The work was [one of the Top 10 most popular](http://gijn.org/2016/08/18/top-ten-ddj-the-weeks-most-popular-data-journalism-links-107/) 
data journalism projects of the week!

### World Bank Carbon Emissions

<a href="http://prototype.thegamma.net"><img src="/img/carbon.png" style="width:200px;float:right;margin:0px 0px 10px 10px" /></a>

This project was an early experiment built around the F# language and a type
provider for World Bank data. The <a href="http://prototype.thegamma.net/carbon">Carbon Emissions</a>
report is an example interactive article built using the prototype. It takes some time to
load, but you can also watch a <a href="https://vimeo.com/140314257">15 minute demo</a>
or a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYoO2RvZn7Y">45 minute talk</a> about the
project.

For more information about the project, see our [Computation + Journalsim 2015 paper](/files/cj2015.pdf),
which explains the early thinking behind The Gamma and interesting technical aspects of the prototype.

### Towards open and transparent data-driven storytelling

This is a talk about The Gamma project done at the [Alan Turing Institute](http://turing.ac.uk),
which is kindly hosting the development of the project. The development of social media has
democratized opinions - meaning that sharing your beliefs has become significantly easier. Can
simplifying data-driven storytelling democratize facts backed by data?

### The Gamma: Programming Tools for Data Journalism

This talk from the [Future Programming workshop](http://www.future-programming.org/2015/index.html)
talks about some of the more technical aspects of The Gamma project and its early prototypes.
The key idea of the talk is that we should see articles as programs - this way, we can apply many
great ideas from programming to verify articles and make them easier to create!
